# Odysseia <!-- omit in toc -->

Odysseia (Ὀδύσσεια) is one of the two famous poems bij Homeros. It describes the journey of Odysseus and his crew to get home. Learning Greek is a bit like that - a odyssey. It is a hobby project that combines a few of my passions, both ancient Greek (history) and finding technical solutions for problems. As This is a hobby project first and foremost any mistakes are my own, either in translation or in interpation of text.

The goal is for people to learn or rehearse ancient Greek. Some of it is in Dutch but most of it is in English. There is also a dictionary that you can search through. Most of it is still very much a work in progress.

### Alexandros - Αλέξανδρος

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/59/Alexander_and_Bucephalus_-_Battle_of_Issus_mosaic_-_Museo_Archeologico_Nazionale_-_Naples_BW.jpg" alt="Alexandros" width="200"/>

What could I ever say in a few lines that would do justice to one of the most influential people of all time? Alexandros's energy and search for the end of the world was relentless, so too is his search for Greek words within odysseia.

### Sokrates - Σωκράτης

ἓν οἶδα ὅτι οὐδὲν οἶδα - I know one thing, that I know nothing

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Raffael_069.jpg" alt="Sokrates" width="200"/>

Sokrates (on the right) is a figure of mythical propertions. He could stare at the sky for days, weather cold in nothing but a simple cloak. Truly one of the greatest philosophers and a big influence on Plato which is why we know so much about him at all. A sokratic dialogue is a game of wits were the back and forth between Sokrates and whoever was unlucky (or lucky) to be part of the dialogue would end in frustration. Sokrates was known to question anyone until he had proven they truly knew nothing. As the API responsible for creating and asking questions he was the obvious choice.

### Herodotos - Ἡρόδοτος

Ἡροδότου Ἁλικαρνησσέος ἱστορίης ἀπόδεξις ἥδε - This is the display of the inquiry of Herodotos of Halikarnassos

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6f/Marble_bust_of_Herodotos_MET_DT11742.jpg" alt="Sokrates" width="200"/>

Herodotos is often hailed as the father of history. I name he lives up to. His work (the histories) is a lively account of the histories of the Greeks and Persians and how they came into conflict. This API is responsible for passing along sentences you need to translate. They are then checked for accuracy.

## Common

χαλεπὰ τὰ καλά - good things are difficult to attain

Perhaps the most famous Western philosopher, his thoughts have been an influence on Western culture for generations and as he is the rock upon which many philosophers have build there church. It is only fitting that shared code is maintained within the Plato API. Raphael has painted him with Leonardo da Vinci as inspiration.

### Demokritos - Δημόκριτος

By convention sweet is sweet, bitter is bitter, hot is hot, cold is cold, color is color; but in truth there are only atoms and the void.
